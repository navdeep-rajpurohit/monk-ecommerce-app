> Build using Reactjs and MUI



## Note !important
1. Have not implemented logic to avoid duplicate entries as the user can add different set of discount on different set of products/variants. It can be added later
2. The images fetched from api are heave (4-5 mb) hence it affects the performance. Used the libs to optimize performance using lazy loading.
